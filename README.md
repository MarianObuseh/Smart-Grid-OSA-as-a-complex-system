# Modelling Smart Grid Operators Situation Awareness Awareness 
Here, I make an attempt to model the smart grid control room as a chaotic complex system whose operator states evolve by the presence or absence of a social concept called Vigilance Training and certain rules of engagement
I incorporate chaos theory where small perturbations lead to a drastic change in evolving states of agents
I also incorporate Cellular Automata Simulations
Most of the codes are written in Python but the actually Agent Based Modeling is done using a Personal Learning Edition of AnyLogic
